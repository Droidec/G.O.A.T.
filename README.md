> The **Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test (G.O.A.T.)** is a Vault-Tec occupational assessment test that every resident of a vault is required to take at the age of 16.

Our ambition was to simulate the famous starting test in [Fallout 3](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-3), so that everyone could know their role in a fallout shelter, in case of nuclear war.

The test consists of a sequence of ten questions about how you would act in certain situations. The responses to these questions determine the job you are best suited for.

## Build & Usage

Then, call the binary as follows:
